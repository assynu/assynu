# About me
Hey there! I'm a 19-year-old student and software developer from central Poland. I love solving any type of problems, so programming is actually not a job for me, but more of a passion. I can build all sorts of things – from websites to mobile apps to desktop software – but I'm really into backend development. I'm always learning new stuff and trying to keep up with the latest tech trends. If you've got a project or an idea you'd like to talk about, feel free to write to me.
